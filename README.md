# API Generation ðŸ¤–

This project uses [roslyn](https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn) to create an API from open api specification.
View a post on the idea behind this project [here](https://www.maisiesadler.co.uk/api-generation/blog).

This ensures that the application is always returning models that match the defined API specification.

The project creates
- Controller [e.g.](example/generated/ApiTodoController.cs)
- Models [e.g.](example/generated/models/ToDoItem.cs)
- Interface describing each action [e.g.](example/generated/interactors/IGetApiTodoInteractor.cs)

This can then be implemented in the project with any custom logic, [e.g.](example/implementations/GetApiTodoInteractor.cs).

The above examples are from the [example project](./example) generated by the [definition](./definition.json) file in the root of the project. 
All of the generated files are in the [generated](./example/generated) folder in that project, this folder is deleted and recreated on each run.

Running `dotnet run --project example` and navigating to `http://localhost:5009/api/todo` produces the following response:

## Usage

There are two available projects [OpenApiSpecGeneration.ApiGeneration](./src/OpenApiSpecGeneration.ApiGeneration) and [OpenApiSpecGeneration.ApiGeneration.Console](./src/OpenApiSpecGeneration.ApiGeneration.Console).

The first can be used as a package (soon) and the second is a console app that takes an input file and produces c# files to the gievn output directory. See the project folder for more details on usage.

## What's supported

### Reading open api specs

The [console app](src/OpenApiSpecGeneration.ApiGeneration.Console) takes an input json openapi spec and outputs C# files to the given output directory.

Our API specs are defined in YAML, since this is not easily parsed in dotnet I have created a tool [yamltojson](./yamltojson) that takes a YAML file and outputs a JSON file which can then be used by the console app.
